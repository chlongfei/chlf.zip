    Did you think this was a real zip file? You shouldn't click on files you don't 100% know are safe!

    <h2>What did I click on?</h2>
    <p>
        This is just a static webpage hosted on a .zip domain. I needed a trusted site to test firewall rules for blocking these hooligan domains, so I just bought one. LOL
        <br>
        As an added bonus, a .sh file is attempted to be downloaded on load, which should've been blocked by your browser or antivirus.
        <br>
        Don't worry, this site is kept as dumb as possible for the safeties.
